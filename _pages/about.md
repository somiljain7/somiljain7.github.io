I'm an AI/ML Developer with experience in speech and document intelligence. Iâ€™ve worked with top institutes like NITK, IISc, and NTU in the speech domain, exploring cutting-edge techniques in speaker diarization, language identification, and speech processing. My work includes OCR-based table extraction, conversational AI, and research-driven development of scalable AI solutions. I specialize in technologies like Kaldi, Hugging Face, Docker, LangChain, and cloud platforms like GCP. Passionate about innovation, I strive to push the boundaries of AI performance.
