Hello! I am a Junior Research Fellow at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, specializing in speech signal processing. With a strong background in machine learning and natural language processing, I am passionate about exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in speech signal processing and NLP. My research interests lie in speaker diarization and language identification, and I am always looking for opportunities to develop my skills and knowledge as a lifelong learner.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also worked as a Data Science intern at Stride.ai Inc, where I applied deep learning techniques in image processing and data extraction. As a Research Engineer at OpenMined, I worked on privacy-preserving machine learning techniques and natural language processing techniques.

Overall, I am excited about the possibilities that the intersection of technology and language processing can bring, and I am dedicated to contributing to this field in meaningful ways.
