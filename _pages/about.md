Hello! I specialize in developing image, text, and speech-based models, with a strong inclination towards advanced deep learning techniques. My journey began as a Junior Research Fellow at NITK, where I focused on information retrieval systems, specifically in speaker diarization and language identification. This experience equipped me with a solid foundation in machine learning and natural language processing.

In addition to my academic stint, I gained valuable industry experience through 1.5 years of internships. These internships were diverse, allowing me to delve into areas such as conversational AI and information retrieval systems. This practical exposure enhanced my skills and broadened my understanding of real-world applications.

My strengths lie in my ability to tackle complex challenges by leveraging cutting-edge deep learning models. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology and continuously seek opportunities to expand my expertise and contribute meaningfully to the field.
