I am a huge fan of Python's platform independence, which allows us to call shell scripts or run Python bindings of different frameworks built on CPP, among other things. Recently, I organized a talk with the help of the Mozilla Campus Club BVP, where I provided a basic introduction to logic building and OOPs for freshers at BVUCOEP.
